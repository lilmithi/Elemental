          It's no secret that we live in unprecedented times. Our world is
          facing a global mental health epidemic and the challenges thet lie
          before us demand new approaches to how we lead ourselves and others.

        <p>
          Yet, with more to do, less time to do it in, more complexity and
          moving parts, it's easy to become disconnected and depleted and as a
          result experience higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression. In
          fact, according to a recent poll by Forbes, nearly 60% of leaders
          experience burnout.
